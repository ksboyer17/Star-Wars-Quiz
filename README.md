# Star-Wars-Quiz

In every generation there is media that is impactful in development. In our group Star Wars is the most profound, epic, cinematic movie series of our time. This fact is exactly what inspired our team to create this project.

In the user eyes, we wanted to provide them with an introduction to our application and to entice them to want to take our character quiz. The way we achieved this is providing an introductory statement, which can be found below.

"In life emotion is fickle. It is said that to control ones emotional state is to harness absolute power. Some galaxians are born predisposed to certain emotions, while others grapple with the temptations of light and darkness incessantly. Ceaselessly grappling with the forces at be leaves many galaxians defenseless against darkness. Have you fallen to darkness? Has light prevailed? Proceed with caution to determine your side of the force, your allegiances, your character, but remember “You can’t stop the change, any more than you can stop the suns from setting.” — Shmi Skywalker."

In order to align users with a character, we assigned point values to questions and to the characters. Depending on the point value scored through the quiz, users have the chance to be assigned any of the characters below.
